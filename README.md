# What is Rested XP

When a player logs out of the game their character enters a rested state which gradually accumulates rested XP over time. This rested XP bonus can then be utilized when the player logs back into the game. Its providing them with an increased rate of experience point gain for a certain period of time.

By accumulating rested XP players can effectively "bank" extra experience points and use them strategically to expedite their leveling process.

Rested XP mechanics vary between different games but the general concept remains the same. Typically, players can accumulate a certain amount of rested XP which is represented by a bar or a percentage indicator.

Once a player logs back into the game their character will start consuming their accumulated rested XP at an increased rate. The duration of the rested XP bonus can vary but it is usually finite and will eventually be depleted.

By utilizing their accumulated rested XP during the most opportune moments players can maximize their experience point gain and progress through the game at a faster pace. It also provides an additional layer of strategy and decision-making, as players must decide when and how to use their rested XP for the greatest benefit.
